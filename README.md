# DialogSystem

My name is [Adria Avila](https://github.com/Avilgor) and I'm currently studing a videogame design and development degree in Citm (UPC collage).
This proposition is about what is and how to do a dialog system in videogames. For it I made a website [here](https://avilgor.github.io/DialogSystem/) with
all the information I've searched about and a step-by-step tutorial to develop one basic dialog system.
