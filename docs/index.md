# Dialog System


## Introduction

Here you will found some usefull information about what is a dialog system, examples of it, why it is used and how to do one. 
We will see different types of dialog systems, examples of games that have one and a little step by step tutorial to do one basic system.

## Dialog System?

The dialog system is that part of the game or app which control the dialog interaction between the user and/or IA interactions. In some games 
we can interact with it, making decisions which can or not inflict in the story or future actions, and in other cases the player can only see
how the AI interacts with itself. Not all decisions that we can make are important, there are can be dialogs systems which don't save the 
decisions you made, it is all about the game you want to do and the importance you want to give to making decisions.

To do a GOOD dialog system, there are one thing that has to be done before starting coding, planing a dialog tree. A dialog tree is where all 
the decisions are schedule, setting the possible answers and next questions to ask or answers to give.

That image is a clear example of a dialog tree. It is a simple dialog only taken into account, but for a larger one the basis is the same, 
you only have to include more options and further questions/answers.

## Why we use it?

In a RTS game it can be used to introduce the story or make gameplay decisions, like events, alliances...

In the game "Stellaris", sometimes you have to make decisions that involve other races in the univers. Those decisions are the base for the alliance
system the game has.
