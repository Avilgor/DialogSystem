# Dialog System


## Introduction

Here you will found some usefull information about what is a dialog system, examples of it, why it is used and how to do one. 
We will see different types of dialog systems, examples of games that have one and a little step by step tutorial to do one basic system.

## Dialog System?

The dialog system is that part of the game or app which control the dialog interaction between the user and/or IA interactions. In some games 
we can interact with it, making decisions which can or not inflict in the story or future actions, and in other cases the player can only see
how the AI interacts with itself. Not all decisions that we can make are important, there are can be dialogs systems which don't save the 
decisions you made, it is all about the game you want to do and the importance you want to give to making decisions.

To do a GOOD dialog system, there are one thing that has to be done before starting coding, planing a dialog tree. A dialog tree is where all 
the decisions are schedule, setting the possible answers and next questions to ask or answers to give.

That image is a clear example of a dialog tree. It is a simple dialog only taken into account, but for a larger one the basis is the same, 
you only have to include more options and further questions/answers.

## Why we use it?

In a RTS game it can be used to introduce the story or make gameplay decisions, like events, alliances...

In the game "Stellaris", sometimes you have to make decisions that involve other races in the univers. Those decisions are the base for the alliance system the game has.

Other games that also use a dialog system are Skyrim and Fallout, which are good known in the industry for the amount of dialogues and 
decisions they have. Sometimes, one of the most criticized parts in a videogame is the dialog system, being answers not clear enough or not having enough impact in the story.

In both cases is well done, having multiple options that we can see fully the whole text or almost it. Which allow us to decide correctly what to choose knowing what it means.

That last one was one of the reasons that people complain about "Fallout 4", the dialog system is awful compared whith the previous ones. The answers are not clear enough, which is a problem bacause players expect a certain result when taking a decision, and if it is not what he/she expected he/she can be dissapointed. 

Another dialog system is the one used in "Sims" games. Which is different from the others because it doesn't use words, only for the player to choose what to do, but to know if out decision was succesful we have to look at the images that explain what are they talking about or how they feel.

Knowing that there is not only one way to do it, it is up to you to decide how you want it to be.
